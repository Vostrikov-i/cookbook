# cookbook

It contains other my packages.

  ## Math package
  
  Now it contains:
  
  Wrapper for 2 dimensions function y= f(x). It contains
  - calculation of definite integrals for this function
  - finding a minimum of the function
  
  #### TODO:
  
  Wrapper for N dimensions function y = f(x1...xN)
  - finding a minimum of this function using Nesterov Accelerated Gradient and Momentum alghoritm or SGD. Yes, I know that Python contain this algoritm
  
 Matrix operations
  
 
   ## Data processing package
   
   It's simple framework for getting data from data sources, preparing it and sending to consumers
   It contains:
   - Annotation
   - Interfaces
   - Examples
   
  You can do it at the Spring Framework too, but I had situations, when our customers didn't allow using third-party frameworks (yes, and Spring too)
  Perhaps, it can be useful for you.
  
  #### TODO:
  
  - new Producers implementations (with blocking queue, with non blocking queue)
  - new DataSource implementations (read data from data base, read data from socket)
